# pretty-hurts.github.io
An HTML and CSS website project that was assigned in a post-secondary Digital Media course. The theme was to deliver a narrative about the word "unseen". 
My website is about girls hiding their natural beauty to fit in with society's unrealistic beauty standards and tells the story of the unseen pain 
many girls go through which I believe should be brought to light. My website is built to convey this message and also to empower women and girls 
to accept their natural beauty and not be afraid to share their experiences.
